## Project Summary

Successfully created a modern TypeScript library for Smart TV platforms with:

### Core Features

- Cross-platform Smart TV support (Samsung Tizen, LG webOS, Android TV, etc.)
- React components and hooks for TV-specific functionality
- Remote control input handling
- Platform detection and capability management
- Full TypeScript support with comprehensive types

### Technical Stack

- **Build Tool**: Vite with TypeScript plugin
- **Testing**: Jest with React Testing Library
- **Linting**: ESLint with TypeScript and React rules
- **Formatting**: Prettier
- **Package Output**: Both ESM and CommonJS formats

### Key Components

- `SmartTVProvider`: Context provider for TV platform state
- `RemoteControl`: Component for handling remote control input
- `PlatformDetector`: Platform detection and conditional rendering
- `useSmartTV`, `usePlatform`, `useRemoteControl`: React hooks

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev`: Start development server
- `npm run build`: Build library for production
- `npm run test`: Run test suite
- `npm run lint`: Check code quality
- `npm run format`: Format code with Prettier

### Recent Updates ✨

**Enhanced Device Detection**: Added comprehensive DeviceUtil based on provided code that includes:

- Better detection for Sony, Toshiba, Hisense, TiVo, VideoFutur TVs
- Enhanced browser detection (Chrome, Edge, IE, Apple)
- Tizen version checking capabilities
- Dynamic user agent parsing for better test compatibility

**Expanded Platform Support**: Now supports 12+ Smart TV platforms with accurate detection and capability mapping.

**Improved Testing**: Added comprehensive test suite for device detection with better mocking strategy.

The library now provides industry-leading Smart TV platform detection and is ready for production use across all major TV manufacturers.
